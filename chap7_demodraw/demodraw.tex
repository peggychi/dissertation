Illustrations of human movements are used to communicate ideas and convey instructions in many domains, but creating them is time-consuming and requires skill.
We introduce a multimodal approach for people to generate these illustrations by physically demonstrating the movements.
Our \systemname{} system segments speech and 3D joint motion captured by a Kinect RGB-D sensor into a sequence of motion segments, each characterized by a key pose and salient joint trajectories.
Based on this sequence, a series of illustrations is automatically generated using a stylistically rendered 3D avatar annotated with arrows to convey movements.
During demonstration, users can also navigate existing illustrations using speech and amend or re-perform motions if needed. Once a suitable sequence of steps has been created, our system provides a \phaseII{} for finer control of visualization parameters.
In a three-part evaluation, we validate the effectiveness of the generated illustrations and the usability of both the \phaseI{} and the \phaseII{}.
Our results show that our participants could create 4-7 step-by-step illustrations from demonstrations in 22 minutes on average.
