\section{Conclusion}

In this thesis, we present video-based approaches designed for amateur users to produce and consume effective instructions from demonstrations. Using video and audio analysis techniques, our tools support recording, editing, and playback in a tutorial production process. We demonstrate results of our computer-generated tutorials from several domains, including software applications and physical activities. Our goal is to increase the quality of instructions created by tutorial authors and to support learners navigating and following the tutorials.
