This dissertation could not have been accomplished without the tremendous supports from the following researchers and friends:

I first would like to thank my advisor, Bj\"orn Hartmann, for opening up research opportunities and collaborations that lead me to where I am today.
%
... interests in videos; internships and fellowships (Berkeley Fellowship and Google PhD Fellowship);
%
It was fun biking at the Google main campus, brainstorming for a caf\'{e} to visit, and of course, research ideas.
% I'm grateful to become Bj\"orn's one of the first PhD graduates, where I spent such pleasant five years with several exciting research projects.
%
I also thank Eric Paulos, Kyle Steinfeld, and Marti Hearst on my committee for their valuable and encouraging feedback.

I feel so grateful to have opportunities to work with top researchers during and beyond my internships at industrial labs over these five years: Mira Dontcheva and Wilmot Li at Adobe Research. Steven M. Drucker and Bongshin Lee at Microsoft Research. Yang Li at Google Research. Daniel Vogel who has been meeting remotely with us.

% A very important basis of this thesis comes from literature and narrative studies. I'd like to express my deepest gratitude to my readers who brought me to this inspiring, graceful field, introduced the significant resource, and provided their insightful comments: Prof. Nick Montfort, who offered a wonderful class of interactive narrative with the support of his excellent research, open-minded attitudes, and logical ways of thinking, and Prof. Fox Harrell, who involves in both Al and narrative research with his innovative approaches and wide knowledge on different fields. Because of them, I've been enchanted to the world of computational narratives, and will continue my adventure.

% The encouragement from the lab sponsors and visitors are gratefully acknowledged, especially: ITRI (Industrial Technology Research Institute) from Taiwan for their fellowship support of my studies in year 2010 and the workshop opportunity together with Henry and Rob, Hallmark for their high interests and many valuable discussions, and InfoCast for their interests and hosting us in Hong Kong. I'd also like to thank the participants of the Media Lab sponsor weeks during these two years, and all the reviewers and participants in the conferences UIST and CHI for their feedback on refinement over these research iterations.

% I wish to extend my warmest thanks to friends at Berkeley and the Bay Area - there are too many people for whom I have great regard. Because of all the precious memories we have, I could personally experience and observe many wonderful life stories. Here I'd like to particularly single out those who supported this study in various ways: . My longtime mentors Prof. Hao-hua Chu, Prof. Robin Bing-yu Chen, and Prof. Jane Yung-jen Hsu at National Taiwan University have been guided and influenced me.

% Finally and most importantly, this thesis is dedicated to my dearest family: my father, my mother, my sister, .

% Their love, care, inspiration, patience, and encouragement, have made all of this possible and positively supported me moving forward.
