% This dissertation could not have been accomplished without the tremendous supports from the following researchers, mentors, and friends:
%
I first would like to thank my advisor, Bj\"orn Hartmann, for opening up research opportunities and collaborations that led me to where I am today.
%
Bj\"orn's full support of my interest in videos, which I derived from my previous work at the MIT Media Lab, introduced me a fascinating domain that I truly enjoy exploring. Working with Bj\"orn made five years to be short as ideas emerge quickly in every other discussion. I also thank him for his encouragement on my four summer internships that navigated me to my full-time position. I must mention that it was fun biking together at the Google campus, where we brainstormed which caf\'{e} to visit, and of course, research topics.
% : computational instructional design
I would also want to thank Eric Paulos, Kyle Steinfeld, and Marti Hearst on my quals and thesis committee for their valuable and encouraging feedback, which drove my work forward as a whole.

I feel so grateful to be able to work closely with external researchers over these five years: after meeting at my first UIST, our collaboration with Mira Dontcheva and Wilmot Li at Adobe Research quickly thrived to one exciting work, and went on to be three fruitful projects. Their thoughtful, patient, and cheerful guidance indirectly assure me to join industrial research.
%
Steven M. Drucker and Bongshin Lee at Microsoft Research aroused my interest in visualization under their mentorship.
%
Daniel Vogel's role transitioned from my interviewee to the key author has been a great fortune to me.
%
Finally, Yang Li at Google Research expanded my view to another research topic that we earned a best paper award together with Bj\"orn.

This dissertation could not have been accomplished without the supports from students in projects: Sally Ahn, Amanda Ren, Joyce Liu, Jason Linder, Derrick Cheng, and Taeil Kwak. I wish to extend my thanks to our research group, Berkeley Institute of Design, Visual Computer Lab, and EECS: Amy Pavel and Andrew Head for their continuous research support, Fu-chung Huang, Nicholas Kong, Kenghao Chang, Tsung-hsiang Chang, and Chung-wei Lin for advice as fresh PhDs, Valkyrie Savage and Shiry Ginosar for making the best and very first ``b-crew'', Steven Rubin for his expertise in audio research, William McGrath for AR research, and Cesar Torres and Tim Campbell as a ``tutorial family.''

The encouragement from the university and industry are gratefully acknowledged, especially the Berkeley Fellowship for Graduate Study and Google for their PhD Fellowship support of my studies. My longtime mentors Hao Chu, Robin Chen, Jimmy Lin, and Henry Lieberman have been guided and influenced me.

Finally, this dissertation is dedicated to my dearest family: my parents, Rock Chi and Joanna Chen, my sister, Hsin-yu Chi, my husband, Senpo Hu, and my adorable daughter, Marissa Hu. I thank them for their tremendous love and support.
