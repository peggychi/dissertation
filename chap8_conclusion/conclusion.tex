\section{Restatement of Contributions}
In this dissertation,

% How to design tutorial systems appropriately for different situations
% * level of expertise of instructor, learner
% * what are you trying to make easier?

\section{Remaining Challenges and Future Directions}

formal language
- now template, a set of techniques

\subsection{Collaborative Authoring}
a team, beyond a single author for larger projects or tasks

\subsection{Non-Linear Tutorials}
branching

\subsection{Mobile Capturing devices}
Tango, Structure Sensor, Leap Motion

\subsection{Emerging Instructional Space}

Augmented and virtual reality systems are becoming available to end users via affordable forms. However, designing AR and VR experiences extremely requires expertise and efforts. As devices offer personalized effects supported by sensing and input techniques, we need new authoring tools that focus on delivering story-centric experiences. Tools should also enable both professionals and amateurs to create and iterate designs efficiently in an immersive 3D world. ...research what future AR and VR creation tools would look like with new authoring processes.

\section{Conclusion}
In this dissertation, we present video-based approaches designed for amateur users to produce and consume effective instructions from demonstrations. Using video and audio analysis techniques, our tools support recording, editing, and playback in a tutorial production process. We demonstrate results of our computer-generated tutorials from several domains, including software applications and physical activities. Our goal is to increase the quality of instructions created by tutorial authors and to support learners navigating and following the tutorials.
