\section{Conclusion}

This chapter introduced DemoWiz, a system with a refined workflow that helps presenters capture software demonstrations, edit and rehearse them, and re-perform them for an engaging live presentation. DemoWiz visualizes input events and guides presenters to see what's coming up by overlaying visual annotations of events on the screencast recording where the events happen in a screencast video. It also provides lightweight editing for presenters to adjust video playback speed, pause frames, and add text notes. A user study showed that DemoWiz was effective in helping presenters capture timing and narrate over a demo video.
