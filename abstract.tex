This thesis introduces video-based recording, editing, and playback tools optimized for creating and consuming interactive tutorials from author demonstrations. Using video and audio analysis techniques, our goal is to dramatically reduce the effort required to produce high-quality instructions for amateur creators. By designing new tutorial formats combined with video content, our tools in turn improve viewers' learning experience. We show a series of systems that create effective tutorials to support this vision. Our approaches acquire videos and high-level events that are important to a learner. Information is derived from either software event logs or user annotations of physical activities using our authoring tools. By combining the input streams, we design algorithms that automatically generate novel instructional formats, which can be edited by authors. We describe the significance and challenges of our video-based methods with a series of study results.
