% \chapter{DemoCut: Generating Concise Instructional Videos for Physical Demonstrations}

Amateur instructional videos often show a single
uninterrupted take of a recorded demonstration without any edits.
While easy to produce, such videos are often too long as they
include unnecessary or repetitive actions as well as mistakes. We introduce
DemoCut, a semi-automatic video editing system that improves the quality of amateur instructional videos for physical
tasks. DemoCut asks users to mark key moments in a recorded demonstration using a set of marker types derived from our formative study.
%
Based on these markers, the system uses audio and video analysis to automatically
organize the video into meaningful segments and apply appropriate
video editing effects.
%
To understand the effectiveness of DemoCut, we report a technical evaluation of seven video tutorials created with DemoCut. In a separate user evaluation, all eight participants successfully created a complete tutorial with a variety of video editing effects using our system.
