\subsection{Implementation}
The video and audio analysis is implemented in Matlab. The Annotation and Editing Interfaces are implemented with standard Web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript). An Apache web server hosts these web pages and sends the user annotations to the back-end Matlab system.
%Once the video is processed, the server updates the video rendered with generated metadata on the web interface. When user modified the automatic effects and text annotation in real-time, DemoCut records the changes and updates the metadata for outputs.
